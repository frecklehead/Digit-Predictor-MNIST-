# Digit Recognizer: Draw and Predict

This Django project provides a simple web application that allows users to draw digits on a canvas and receive a prediction of the digit. The prediction is powered by a machine learning model trained on the MNIST dataset.

## Features
- **Interactive Canvas:** Users can draw digits directly on the canvas using their mouse or touch screen.
- **Prediction Engine:** A trained machine learning model analyzes the drawn image and predicts the digit.
- **Real-time Feedback:** The predicted digit is displayed immediately after the user finishes drawing.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/digit-recognizer.git
